# AMAR Founders Take Home Exercise

This repository contains the solution for the take-home exercise for a full-stack role at AMAR Founders. The project consists of a client-side (frontend) application and a server-side (backend) application.

## Project Overview

The project simulates a real-time quote display for financial symbols. The backend server generates and updates quotes for a set of predefined symbols (AAPL, GOOGL, BTCUSD) and exposes an API to fetch these quotes. The frontend client fetches and displays these quotes, updating them in real-time.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
AMAR-TAKE-HOME/
├── client/          # Frontend application (React, Next.js, TypeScript)
│   ├── ...
│   └── README.md    # README for the client application

└── README.md        # Main README for the entire project
